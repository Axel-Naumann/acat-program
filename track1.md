This track includes topics that impact how we do physics analysis and research that are related to the enabling technology. Here is a fairly detailed list of possibilities (which isn't, of course, complete!).

  - Languages, Software quality, IDE and User Interfaces
    - Languages (new C++ standard, Java, ...), language interoperability, code portability
    - Software quality assurance; code reflection; documentation, performance and debugging tools
    - Computer system Benchmarking, beyond Linpack  
    - IDE and frameworks
    - User Interfaces, Common Libraries.
  - Distributed and Parallel Computing
    - Multilevel parallelism
    - Distributed computing
    - GRID and Cloud computing
  - Architectures
    - New architectures
    - Massive Multicore
    - High Performance Computing
    - Accelerator-based computing (GPGPU’s, FPGA’s)
    - High and low precision floating-point (quad/octuple precision and short float for CUDA)
  - Virtualization
    - Containerization (shifter, remote scripting)
    - Hardware abstraction
    - Clouds
  - Networking
    - New TCP control and routing mechanism
    - Alternative to ethernet
  - Online computing
    - Advanced Monitoring, Diagnostics and Control
    - Scalable distributed data collectors
    - High Level Triggering (HLT)
    - Stream event processing & High Throughput Computing (HTC)
