How do we do physics analysis and research, what are enabling technologies?

  - Software
    - Languages, interoperability
    - Software development and quality
  - Computing
    - Distributed and parallel computing, including programming models
    - Architectures, from accelerators (GPU, ASIC, FPGA) to HPC
    - Floating-point models
    - Hardware abstractions
    - Online computing, including data transfer, High Level Triggering (HLT)
    - Advanced computing models such as Quantum Computing
  - Data
    - Data transfer, networking
    - Data formats and compression
  - Simulation and visualization
    - Detector and accelerator simulations, full and fast
    - Visualization techniques; event displays
