There are as many different algorithms and methods as their are physicists. Obviously, we can't list them all here, but here are some broad outlines of techniques that fit into this category. Of course, new and novel categories are part of what this conference is looking for.

  - Machine Learning
    - Neural Networks and Other Pattern Recognition Techniques
    - Evolutionary and Genetic Algorithms
    - Package Benchmarking
    - Automation of Science: Data to formula
  - Advanced Data Analysis Environments
    - Statistical Methods, Multivariate analysis
    - Data mining
  - Simulation, Reconstruction and Visualization Techniques
    - New algorithms for finding tracks, or other objects.
    - Detector and Accelerator Simulations, MC and fast MC
Reconstruction Algorithms
    - Visualization Techniques; event displays
  - Advanced Computing
    - Quantum Computing
    - Bio Computing: life process simulation, brain simulation, quantum biology
